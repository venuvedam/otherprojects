Can Artificial Intelligence lead you to Carbon-Negative state?
===============================================================
# Abstract
What is the AI footprint of Microsoft Copilot? The year's hot product in the market is Copilot for Microsoft 365. Adding this to your workforce is going to increase the carbon footprint of your 200 member strong organization by X% throwing a spanner into the sustainability goals that you have for your organization. AI by nature is resource intensive and at the same time incredibly useful to the organization. It could improve the organization's overall productivity by a factor of Y. Yet, it is at loggerheads with your sustainability goal. Whether or not you want to remove more carbon from the atmosphere of this delicately poised blue green planet in the solar system than you are pumping into it, you need to figure out a way to make progress on both these fronts - preferably simultaneously. 

This article/paper/blog/perspective attempts to provide some direction on how you, as a large organization, can have your cake and eat it too. We will focus on Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 technologies but the underlying principles are sufficiently generic for you to implement using other tech stacks as well. We have only one planet, for better or worse, unless those aliens coming our way from 4 light years away are real! If you have no idea what I am talking about, you should just go to Netflix and stream 3 body problem. 

That besides the point, before we continue further I feel it is my fiduciary responsibility to clarify something. First of all, I have no idea why I used the term fiduciary there but it sounded incredibly cool. Secondly, no word in this article will be auto-generated or created by AI. That includes our own products such as Copilot for Microsoft 365, Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Twitter Grok, Facebook Llama, Mistral AI, Venudiot AI. (OK I made that last one up. It is only fitting that I should hallucinate a bit too to make the playing field level. 

We may have used Copilot to search for information or find documentation links. However, it was all for research purposes. The actual content of this paper is purely human generated. Whether that is a good thing, is a matter of debate of course. As a human, we are biased but the world now mostly agrees that AI is in fact a new species on Earth. So, maybe there are two sides to the coin. This blog is, by no stretch of human imagination, an equal opportunity initiative.

Now that we are clear on that aspect, let us dive in.
